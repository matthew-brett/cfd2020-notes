## Marks

Please do not worry about your marks.

Here is a short pause.

Please do not worry about your marks.

Your job, in this course, is to learn to think straight, about what can and
cannot be learned from data.  Along the way, we hope that you will find that
you are exploring interesting data and finding answers to interesting
questions.  If you have fun, as we hope you do, you will do well on the
course.

After every class, there will be an exercise for you to do.   Please use these
to find out how well you are doing, and to help us find out what we have
taught you, and what we have failed to teach, so we can do better in the next
class.

Please feel free to work together on these exercises, but remember that *you
must work independently on the graded assessments*.  See the notes on [working
together](Working together)

## Assessments

There are three graded assessments.

1. Coursework 1: 15%; deadline 6 November 2020
2. Coursework 2: 15%; deadline 30 November 2020
3. Structured data analysis: 70%; deadline 15 January 2021.

All the assessments are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, the format we will be working with throughout the course, for the lectures and exercises.

By the time you submit the first assessment you will be very familiar with the procedure of opening and editing Jupyter Notebooks.  The assignments add the extra step of downloading your completed notebook to your computer, and then submitting to Canvas.

The structured data analysis is, of course, larger than the two smaller
coursework assessments, and counts for 70% of your overall mark.  It consists
of a set of notebooks for you to complete, which vary in the level of
difficulty, and the level of independence you will need to define your problem
and solve it.

## Resit policy

If you fail the module, you may have the option of taking a resit, which will consist of another structured data analysis assignment.
