# Opening Jupyter on your laptop

Make sure you have followed the instructions in the [setup
page](setup).

## Start Jupyter on Windows

Press the Start key.  You should see an entry in the program
list called "Anaconda 64-bit".  This is a list of commands
installed by the Anaconda installer.  Select "Jupyter notebook".
After a short time, a web page will open with the [Jupyter
notebook dashboard].

[Jupyter notebook dashboard]: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#The-Notebook-dashboard

## Start Jupyter on Mac

Open Spotlight by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the top right of screen, or holding down the control key with the space bar.

In the Spotlight Search bar that comes up, type "terminal".  Select the "Terminal" app that should come up as the first option.

A terminal window should open.  You can type commands in this window to run other applications.

Type `jupyter notebook` at the terminal prompt and press return.
After a short while you should get a web browser window with the
[Jupyter notebook dashboard].
