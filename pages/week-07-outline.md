From Tuesday, here is the [solution to fix_my_fors
exercise](../file_contents/course%20files/fix_my_fors_solution.ipynb).

To open the file above on the UOBHub system, download the file to your
computer, then go to <https://uobhub.org>, and use the Upload button towards
the top right of the screen to upload the file.  You should be able to open and
run the file from that interface.

## Exercise

This week's online exercise is
[simulation](https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/simulation&subPath=simulation.ipynb).

The last question in this exercise, along with the hints, is a little past what
you have learned so far.  In particular, if you want to follow the hints, you
should first read:

<https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020/data-frames/boolean_indexing.html>

We'll go through this page next week - it's another fundamental building block
for your life in selecting and changing data.

But - you could also be creative and avoid using this technique, by remembering that, if you know how many aces there are, currently counting as rank 1, and you know the sum of the ranks across all cards when aces count as 1, then you can use that count to work out what the sum of the ranks will be if the aces count as 11.  You may be able to see what I'm getting at when you come to that question.
