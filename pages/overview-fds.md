## Description

This course develops more foundations for data analysis using code.

It follows on from the first semester course [Introduction to Data
Science](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/46369).

As we hope you saw in the first course, coding is a fundamental skill for
modern research.  Learning to code gives you enormous power and flexibility
for data analysis.  It will also give you tools for deeper understanding of
data analysis and statistics.

We build on the code and data machinery that you learned in the last semester
to cover a wider range of analysis methods, and principles for drawing
conclusions from data.

The [project](../modules/373659) is a large part of the course, in terms of
time, and in terms of teaching and [assessment](assessment).

## Teachers and TAs

See [meet the team](meet-the-team).

## What we aim to teach

*   Techniques for working together on data analysis.
*   Finding, cleaning and merging data from different sources.
*   The idea of prediction in statistics and machine learning.
*   Predicting one set of numbers from another, using straight-line
    relationships; simple regressions and correlation.
*   Numerical optimization as a general tool for finding parameters such as
    line slopes and intercepts.
*   Extending prediction by using more than one set of numbers;
    multiple regression.
*   Predicting groups and labels; classification; basic machine learning using
    nearest neighbour classification.
*   Reasoning from prior information; understanding and using Bayesian
    methods.
*   Estimates of uncertainty; confidence intervals; the bootstrap.

## Resources

We will be following the online class textbook at
<https://github.com/matthew-brett/cfd2020>.

We will also be using materials from the [Berkeley 2018 EdX course on data science](data8x).

Please consider further [background reading](Background reading).

You'll also find these resources in the [resource
list](../modules/items/1906844).

## Tools

This course uses [Python and the Jupyter
Notebook](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020/intro/the_software.html).
You do not need to install anything on your computer; we have set up a system
to run [Python / Jupyter in the cloud](python-slash-jupyter-in-the-cloud) so
you can do your work in the cloud, via a web browser.

## Policies

See policies on [working together](Working together).  Please make sure you
read and understand that page; it covers collaboration (very good!) and
straight copying of work (very bad!).

For assessment see [Assessment and Feedback](Assessment and Feedback).
