# Creating and sharing a DeepNote project

Your project should be a "Project" in DeepNote.

First [make and upgrade a DeepNote account](making-a-deepnote-account).

**One team member** should then make and share the project for the group.

This team member should:

* Go to the DeepNote dashboard: <https://deepnote.com/dashboard>.
* Click on the blue "+ Create Project" button towards the top left.
* You now should be looking at the page for the project, currently called
  something like "Untitled Python Project".
* Go to the dropdown box near the top left of the page, with the project name,
  and click on the down arrow to get some options.
* Select "Rename Project" and choose a suitable name.
* Click on the "Share" button towards the top right of the page.
* I recommend that you enable the "Public Access" feature there - but please
  make sure that you have the rights to share your data before you do this.
* From the same "Share" options, click on "Manage collaborators".
* Add your team-members in the box at the bottom of the dialog that comes up,
  make sure you've enabled them as "Admin" or "Edit" (whatever you agree), and then click "Add Collaborator".
* Do this for each team member.
* Make sure you enter their primary Github email - see the [make and upgrade
  a DeepNote account](making-a-deepnote-account) page.
