This page is about the 5 minute pitches you may want to do to interest your colleagues in your data.

First, choose your data - see the [project data](project-data) page.

Next, have a think about what you might say for the data justification, in due course - see the "Describing data..." section on the [project data](project-data) page.

Your pitch should be about five minutes.  You'll get the helm in the Zoom
session, and then you can present in any way you think will be useful.  You
may want to show the website associated with the data, or do a little
mini-presentation, saying something about the data and why you think the data
will be interesting, and some very broad general plan about what you want to
look at first.

We'll leave 5 minutes space for questions afterwards.

You are of course welcome to do data pitches in pairs, even threes, if you
want to attract more group members.
