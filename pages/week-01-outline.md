## This week's activities

Formal teaching starts next week, but this week, please introduce yourself to
the [project](about-the-project).  Please also review the video below introducing the project.

Your job, this week, is to start thinking about what data you would like to analyze, and who you would like to work with.   We will be doing some sessions soon helping you to select among your suggestions, and form teams, for those of you who don't yet have them.
