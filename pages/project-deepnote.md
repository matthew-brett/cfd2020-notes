# Making a DeepNote account

We propose <https://deepnote.com> for your projects.

In order for you to have the time you need to work on the project, you will need to:

* Make yourself a DeepNote account;
* Ask to upgrade your account to an education account.

This page lists the procedure for these two steps.

## Making a DeepNote account

Making a DeepNote account involves two steps:

* Making a Github Account
* Making a DeepNote account with the Github account.

### Making a Github account

<https://github.com> is the main site world-wide for sharing code.  In
particular, there are many Jupyter Notebooks on Github.  You will benefit from
a Github account even if you do not use it for DeepNote.

* Go to <https://github.com>
* Enter your University email address - e.g. `abc123@student.bham.ac.uk`, and
  click "Sign Up for Github".
* Follow the prompts to set up your username and password.

### Make a DeepNote account

* Go to <https://deepnote.com>.
* Click on "Sign Up" at the top left.
* Choose "Continue with Github"
* Enter your Github username or email address (e.g.
  `abc123@student.bham.ac.uk`).
* Enter your Github password.

You should now see the DeepNote dashboard

## Upgrade your account

The account you have so far is a free account.  You need to upgrade your
account to an education account.  DeepNote give [the procedure on their
website](https://docs.deepnote.com/resources/pricing#do-you-offer-student-or-academic-discounts).

You should:

* Create a DeepNote account as above;
* Quoting from the link above:

  > To verify you're a student or a teacher, please send an email to
  <help@deepnote.com> from your academic email address. If your Deepnote
  account is not registered under the academic email, please mention the email
  of the account where we should enable the academic team plan
