The activities for all weeks are just-in-case I (Matthew) get sick, and someone
else needs to teach the class.

If that happens, then we will need to move over the excellent Berkeley teaching
materials in their EdX [data8x](data8x) class.

The Berkeley materials differ from the approach I have taken in the following
ways, in that Berkeley uses its own
[Datascience](https://github.com/data-8/datascience) library to load and
analyze data tables.  In contrast, I am using the more standard, but more
complex [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library for data tables.

Therefore, the suggested online materials all start with the background you
will need to use the Berkeley Datascience library.  You will need this
background in order to follow the later Berkeley materials.

You will see that this difference between the courses is relatively small, and
there is a big overlap in the way we teach.  This is no coincidence; I was
heavily inspired by Berkeley's class in preparing this one.
