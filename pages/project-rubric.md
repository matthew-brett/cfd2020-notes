## Project grading rubric

Your total project mark is out of 100.  This mark in turn makes up 70% of your
course grade.

There are two components to this assessment:

* The project itself, listed below as *project grades*; this accounts for 70
  / 100 of your assessment, and therefore 49% of your overall course mark.
* Your contribution to the project, listed below as *personal contribution*;
  this accounts for 30 / 100 of your assessment, and therefore 21% of your
  overall course mark.

## Project grades

Each of the following 7 sections is worth 10 marks, for a total of 70.

For each row, the table gives a description of work that will earn: between
0 and 50% in this category (fail to bare pass); 50-75% (bare pass to good
pass); and 75-100% (good pass to excellent).

Notice that your project presentation is one category; see [the project
page](about-the-project) for schedule.

## Project report

Your project report should be around 5000 words of explanatory text and code,
not including figures and tables.  If you plan to have much more than this, please contact me in good time to discuss it.

It can be in the form of a PDF document, or a Jupyter Notebook.

Your project report should be *reproducible*.  There should be a file
in your project, called `README`, in any format of your choosing. For
example, the file can be in plain text format, a Jupyter Notebook, or
a Word-processor document.

This file should give the steps which will exactly reproduce the
numbers, tables and figures in your report.

Example instructions for a simple report might be:

> The UK police publish various statistics about their work at
> <https://data.police.uk/data>.
>
> Go to this site, select "August 2018" as the start and end of the "Date
> range", select "West Midlands" in the "Forces" panel, unselect "include
> crime data" and select "include stop and search data".  Download
> and unpack the generated zip file, to give the file
> `2018-08-west-midlands-stop-and-search.csv`.  This should exactly match the
> copy of the data in our project directory, with the same name.
>
> Open `clean_data.ipynb` and run all cells.  This checks and cleans the data,
> writing out the cleaner version as `2018-08-wm-ss-cleaned.csv`.
>
> Open `analyze_data.ipynb` and run all cells.  This writes out the figures
> `figure1.png` and `figure2.png` that you see in our report.
>
> Open `simulate_data.ipynb` and run all cells.  This writes out tables 1 and 2
> that you see in our report.

The `README` file can also be your report.  In that case, your `README`
instructions would be "Run this notebook to generate our report".

## Personal contribution

Each team member should submit a document of up to 1500 words describing their
contribution to the project, under any of the following headings:

* Development of question / hypothesis;
* Data research: search for relevant data to contribute to question;
* Literature review;
* Analysis strategy;
* Analysis code;
* Code review;
* Work planning and organization;
* Improving teamwork and collaboration;
* Testing code and procedures;
* Writing report.

You should describe your own contribution, and any work you did to help other
people contribute to the same area.

You can add other headings if you think we should consider them.

For each heading, give any evidence for your contribution from project files or other data that is accessible to us, your graders.

The mark guidelines for this part are:

* 0-50%: little evidence of contribution or collaboration.  Contributions under
  few headings.  Little effort to help other team members contribute.
* 50-75%: moderate evidence of contribution and collaboration.  Contributions
  under many headings; substantial contributions to more than one heading.
  Evidence that you helped other team members contribute across some headings.
* 75-100%: strong evidence of contribution and collaboration.  Some
  contribution to nearly all headings; substantial contributions across the
  majority of headings.  Strong evidence that you helped other team members contribute across several headings.
