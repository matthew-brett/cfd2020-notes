Your homework may involve [working on a file in the R cloud](Work on exercise in R cloud).

If so, then you will usually need to save your work in the R cloud (see the link above), and then:

* Download the file you have been working on to your laptop.
* Submit the downloaded file via Canvas.

## Downloading from the R cloud

Make sure you have saved your file first - see [working on a file in the
R cloud](Work on exercise in R cloud).

To download your file, go to the bottom right pane in the RStudio interface, and select the "Files" tab.

Select the file that you want to download.

From the "More" dropdown menu, select "Export".

Use the dialog box that comes up to save the file to your laptop.

## Submitting via Canvas

This is just the usual procedure of uploading the file from your laptop to the Canvas assignment page.
