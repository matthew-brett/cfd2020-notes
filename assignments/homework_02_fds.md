Now fill in the notebook, following the instructions in the notebook.

Notice that the OKpy tests in the notebook *do not always check that the
answer is right*; in many cases they only check if the answer is *in the
ballpark*.

So - be careful - the tests can all pass, but that does not mean you will get
full marks for the question.  We have extra tests up our sleeve, that we will
run when we mark the notebooks.

On the other hand, if your OKpy tests don't pass, you definitely won't get
full marks for the question.

When you have finished, don't forget to save the notebook file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/jp_save_checkpoint.png)

Next, download the file to your laptop, with the "Download as ..." item on the
"File" menu.  Download the notebook as a "Notebook (.ipynb)" file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/jp_download_as.png)

Finally, upload the `.ipynb` file from your laptop as the submission for the
assignment.

Please remember the rules for [working together](../pages/Working together).

Also, from that page, remember that we are happy to help you if you have tried
some question, but you are stuck.  We won't give you the answer, but we will
try hard to get you unstuck.

Any problems, use the Discussion section on Canvas, or email
