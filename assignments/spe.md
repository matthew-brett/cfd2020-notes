The exercise consists of seven notebooks.

You can find them at
<https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/spe>.

The exercise counts for 70% of your overall course mark.

Each notebook sits in its own directory, with its own tests and data
files.

Within each notebook, each question counts for the same number of
points, except where it says otherwise in the notebook. You'll see what
we mean.

The number of points for each notebook, from the total of 100, are:

-   `lymphoma`: 10
-   `pandering`: 15
-   `religion`: 10
-   `nobler_monkeys`: 5
-   `oxford_astrazeneca`: 15
-   `titanic`: 20
-   `spouses`: 25

For example, the `lymphoma` notebook has 5 questions. Each counts for 10
/ 5 = 2 marks out of the 100 marks available from this exercise.

The `spouses` notebook allows you a lot more flexibility than the others, and
therefore counts for 25 marks out of the 100 available. See that notebook for
the marking scheme.

We suggest you fill in the notebooks in the order given above. You should
certainly try `titanic` before you get on to `spouses`.

Submit the exercise by:

-   Making a single zip file that contains *all seven directories*, and
    therefore all seven notebooks.  See below for how to do this.

-   Download this zip file by navigating to
    <https://uobhub.org/user-redirect/tree/spe>.  At this point you should see
    directories for each notebook, including `lymphoma`, `pandering` etc. Now
    click on the "Download Directory" button towards to the top right of the
    page.

-   When you do this, you should find you get a dialog to allow you to
    download the zip file containing the `spe` directory to your
    computer.

-   When you check this downloaded zip file, it should contain:

    -   `lymphoma.ipynb` in a directory called `lymphoma`;
    -   `pandering.ipynb` in a directory called `pandering`;
    -   `religion.ipynb` in a directory called `religion`;
    -   `nobler_monkeys.ipynb` in a directory called `nobler_monkeys`;
    -   `oxford_astrazeneca.ipynb` in a directory called
        `oxford_astrazeneca`;
    -   `titanic.ipynb` in a directory called `titanic`;
    -   `spouses.ipynb` in a directory called `spouses`.

    You may want to use other data files for the `spouses` part of the
    exercise. If so, please make sure that these data files are in the
    `spouses` directory in your zip file, along with the `spouses.ipynb`
    notebook.

-   Submit this zip file, containing all five directories and notebooks,
    to Canvas.

Please remember the rules for [working
together](../pages/Working%20together).

Also, from that page, remember that we are happy to help you if you have
tried some question, but you are stuck. We won't give you the answer,
but we will try hard to get you unstuck.
