You can do your exercises in the [Python / Jupyter cloud
system](python-slash-jupyter-in-the-cloud), but you are also welcome to install
Jupyter on your own computer and do the exercises there.  Please contact
<m.brett@bham.ac.uk> for support on doing that.

*Before you do the exercise*, read these two pages from the textbook:

* [More on
  arrays](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020/arrays-iteration/More_on_Arrays.html)
* [Selecting values from an
  array](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020/arrays-iteration/array_indexing.html).

Click the exercise / homework link to go to the exercise.

<https://uobhub.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/more_arrays&subPath=more_arrays.ipynb>

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch
the files you need, and it will open the notebook in your browser.

Now fill in the notebook, following the instructions in the notebook.

Notice that the homework uses the OKpy testing system, as have most of your
exercises.  However, for the homework, the OKpy system *does not always check
that the answer is right*; in many cases it only checks if the answer is *in
the ballpark*.

So - be careful - the tests can all pass, but that does not mean you will get
full marks for the question.  We have extra tests up our sleeve, that we will
run when we mark the notebooks.

On the other hand, if your OKpy tests don't pass, you definitely won't get full
marks for the question.

When you have finished, don't forget to save the notebook file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/jp_save_checkpoint.png)

Next, download the file to your laptop, with the "Download as ..." item on the
"File" menu.  Download the notebook as a "Notebook (.ipynb)" file:

![](../file_contents/course%20files/images/jp_download_as.png)

Finally, upload the `.ipynb` file from your laptop as the submission for the
assignment.

Please remember the rules for [working together](../pages/Working together).

Also, from that page, remember that we are happy to help you if you have tried
some question, but you are stuck.  We won't give you the answer, but we will
try hard to get you unstuck.

Any problems, use the Discussion section on Canvas, or email
<m.brett@bham.ac.uk>.
